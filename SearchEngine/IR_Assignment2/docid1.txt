In April 2016, Fox renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on September 19, 2016.[3] On October 31, 2016, the series received a 22-episode full second season pickup by Fox.[4]
The series focuses on Lucifer Morningstar, the Devil, "who is bored and unhappy as the Lord of Hell and resigns his throne and abandons his kingdom for the beauty of Los Angeles, where he gets his kicks helping the LAPD punish criminals".[5] Lucifer runs a nightclub in Los Angeles called "Lux", with the assistance of his demonic ally Mazikeen or "Maze". After a minor celebrity whom Lucifer once helped achieve fame is murdered outside his club, Lucifer becomes involved with the LAPD when he takes it upon himself to assist Detective Chloe Decker in finding the one responsible so that he can "punish" him. He becomes fascinated with Decker when she appears to be immune to his powers and charms.

In the second season, God's wife escapes Hell and inhabits the body of a dead lawyer. Lucifer's punishment for "mom" is to stay on Earth, as she hates humans. It later turns out that Lucifer was to return mom to Hell or God will take Chloe's life, as per the bargain in season one. Amenadiel later remembers that God sent him to grant the miracle of Penelope Decker becoming pregnant with Chloe; thus Chloe and Lucifer were destined to meet, and the reason why she is both immune to his powers and makes his immortality void in her presence.
