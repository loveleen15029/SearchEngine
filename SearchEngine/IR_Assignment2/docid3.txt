In September 2014, it was reported that DC and Fox were developing a television series based on the Sandman character Lucifer, as originally written by Neil Gaiman.[1] In February 2015, it was announced that Tom Ellis had been cast as Lucifer Morningstar, and that Tom Kapinos would write the pilot, to be directed by Len Wiseman.[7] Lina Esco was originally cast as Maze (Mazikeen),[20] however, the role was later recast with Lesley-Ann Brandt.[16] Nicholas Gonzalez portrayed Dan in the pilot episode.[21]

In May 2015, the series was officially picked up for 13 episodes for the 2015–16 season.[22][23] Fox then hired Almost Human alum Joe Henderson as showrunner, with Kapinos remaining on the series in a lesser capacity.[24]

In June 2016, it was announced that Tricia Helfer had been cast as Lucifer and Amenadiel's mother, Charlotte, and that she was to appear in multiple episodes in season 2.[25] The character was promoted to series regular in July 2016.[26] Aimee Garcia had also been cast as a regular in season 2, playing L.A.P.D.'s forensic scientist Ella Lopez.[27]

In August 2016, executive producer Ildy Modrovich announced the casting of Michael Imperioli as the angel Uriel, Amenadiel and Lucifer's middle brother with "a chip on his shoulder".[28]

Several episodes include musical performances by Tom Ellis, although he has stated in interviews that while it is his vocals, the piano accompaniment seen on screen is not actually him.[29]

Broadcast[edit]
Broadcast on the Fox network in the US, the series is available in the United Kingdom from Amazon Prime[30] and in Australia on FX.[31]

Critical reception[edit]
The pilot episode was screened in July at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con. The pilot was met positively by the viewers, with Bleeding Cool's Dan Wickline praising the episode, saying "the show itself is enjoyable because of the great dialogue and flawless delivery from its lead" and "This version of Lucifer refuses to take almost anything seriously and the show is better for it."[37] Max Nicholson of IGN rated the pilot episode a 6.9/10, praising Tom Ellis's performance as Lucifer and the lighthearted tone of the show, but criticizing the show for essentially being another crime procedural show.[38]

The first season received mixed reviews. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 49% approval rating based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Lucifer's got sex appeal, but the show's hackneyed cop procedural format undermines a potentially entertaining premise."[39] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 49 out of 100, based 22 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[40]

Controversy[edit]
On May 28, 2015, the American Family Association (AFA) website One Million Moms launched a petition to prevent the show's airing.[42] The petition says the new series "will glorify Satan as a caring, likable person in human flesh."[43] It posted the petition on that date and 31,312 had signed the petition by the series' premiere date.[44] The petition on the main AFA website, posted the same date, garnered 134,331 signatures by the premiere date.[45][46] In response to the petition, character creator Neil Gaiman commented on his Tumblr page: "Ah. It seems like only yesterday (but it was 1991) that the "Concerned Mothers of America" announced that they were boycotting The Sandman because it contained lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and trans characters. It was Wanda that upset them most: the idea of a trans-woman in a comic book... They told us they were organizing a boycott of The Sandman, which they would only stop if we wrote to the American Family Association and promised to reform. I wonder if they noticed it didn't work last time, either..."[47] Regardless of the AFA's actions, Fox renewed the series in April 2016 for a second season.[48]
